# USB Playground in Expo Managed React Native

## Overview

This project is a USB playground built with Expo managed React Native. It demonstrates how to connect to a USB device in a React Native app and send/receive data. Specifically, it connects to an ECG device and projects its data stream to a linear chart.

## Features

- Connects to a custom-built ECG device via USB
- Receives and processes data stream from the device
- Displays real-time ECG data on a linear chart

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to showcase:

1. USB device connectivity in React Native
2. Real-time data processing and visualization
3. Integration with custom hardware (ECG device)
